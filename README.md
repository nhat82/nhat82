### Hi, I'm Nhat 👋

CompSci senior at [UMD]([https://medicare.pt?ref=github-caneco](https://www.cs.umd.edu/));<br> [my website](https://nhat82.github.io/)
Founder @ PCOS Compass (https://pcos-compass.vercel.app/). I'm building a period tracker for women with PCOS, who often have irregular periods. 

- ⚙️ I use daily: `.py`, `.java`
- 🔨 I build micro tools to make me more productive or not pay money. Most are private but I'm working on a voice expense tracker because I'm too lazy to type out my receipts.
- 💖 Past life: English major in high school until I joined a robotics club. 
- 💬 I'm best reached via email [nhat.tm.ng@gmail.com](mailto:nhat.tm.ng@gmail.com)
